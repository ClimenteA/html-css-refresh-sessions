# FrontEnd HTML/Tailwind Refresher

Recreated Salesforce, MongoDB, Zendesk landing pages in Tailwind to refresh my frontend knowledge. 

Tech:
- UnoCSS with Tailwind classes;
- AlpineJS for dynamic elements (toggles, menu etc);
- HTML/CSS;


NOTE: Websites are not fully complete. Only desktop version was done.
